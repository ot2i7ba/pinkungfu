# pinkungfu
A Python script that generates possible PIN combinations based on user input and writes them to a text file. The output file can be splitted if desired. The generated text files can be imported into forensic software such as from Cellebrite to be used for bruteforce methods.

The script pinkungfu_gui.py uses tkinter for a simple GUI. Otherwise the basic functions of both scripts are identical.
